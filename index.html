							</header>
						</div>
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/d/1a3.jpg" alt="" /></span>This is a side-project of my own that had begun when back and legs ached from sitting long hours which led me down a online search for a manually adjustable standing desk that tilts.  To my surprise, there were no such product on the market, so I designed one myself in SolidWorks with manufacturability and affordability a priority. What I came up with is a desk that can go from a height of 44" down to 27" and go from being level to 6° or 13° of tilt. One rotation of the handle adjusts the height a finely tunable 3/8 of an inch. Inside both legs of the desk are miter gears translating the torque from the crank handle to a helical screw. The threads of the helical screw create the lifting force to raise the desk by pushing against female threads anchored in the leg bases.</p>

							<h3>Cantilever Trellis Pergola</h3>
						</header>
						<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/p/2a.jpg" alt="" /></span>Following the completion of my uncle's outdoor kitchen him and I build, we agreed something was needed to protect it from the elements while being aesthetically pleasing. Not wanting to overwhelm the patio with a traditional 4-post pergola, I proposed a cantilevered trellis structure that admirably accents his Tudor home.  This cantilever pergola maintains an open feeling yet provides a sense of intimacy and privacy where it’s needed. Several engineering solutions were incorporated to facilitate the cantilever, thereby keeping the patio free from vertical support posts while maintaining a safe stucture for years to come.   Constructing is planned to begin in the spring 23'. To see how the outdoor kitchen came out and how it currently is without a pergola, <a href="outdoorkitchen"><strong>click here</strong></a>.</p>

									<h3>Static mixer</h3>
									<p>This CFD simulation analyzes a static mixer with two inputs and out output. The two inputs delivery water at two different temperatures and velocities. After constraining all of the inlets and outlets, the flow body was defined. It was seen that the outlet velocity and pressure was higher than the input. This is consistent with Bernoulli’s equations. It was also seen that the temperature at the outlet was above the lower input temperature but lower than the higher input temperature</p>

									<h3>Spur gear</h3>
									<p>This ANSYS simulation examined the interaction between a gear and pinion system. The process of this simulation included, creating two gears, creating an assembly, and setting up the gear and pinion mating. Once the assembly was setup, the gear assembly could be imported into ANSYS for analysis. The gears were given a fine mesh with a concentration on the edges where the gears make contact. This was done for increased accuracy in known high stress areas. The findings show that the Factor of Safety was a mere .284 which is very low. This result indicates that the gears need to be increased in size or the load needs to be reduced in order to increase reliability.</p>

									<h3>Ride on suspension</h3>
									<p>This ANSYS simulation aimed to show the suspension on a ride-on ride. The simulation showed that the largest deformation was where the kid placed his 50lbs of weight. The largest equivalent stress occurred on the 12in radius curve. This is also where the smallest factor of safety occurred which was a little over 1. The largest factor of safety was 15. </p>

									<h3>Pump housing</h3>
									<p>This ANSYS simulation involved a thermal stress analysis on a pump housing. The housing had a fixed support on its bottom mating surface and frictionless supports on the surround countersink holes. The exterior surface was exposed to a convention with an ambient temperature of 20 degrees Celsius. The inner surface was set to a constant 90 degrees Celsius while the bottom mating surface was set to a constant 60 degrees Celsius. After looking at the results, the maximum temperature was 90 degrees Celsius which occurred at the top surface near the large central hole. The minimum temperature occurred just outside the countersink holes along the perimeter of the pump housing. The largest equivalent stresses occurred at the frictionless countersink holes while the largest deformation occurred at the top exit hole. The factor of safety for the aluminum pump housing was a maximum of 15 and a minimum of .46999. This indicates that a lot more optimization needs to be done for the pump housing. </p>

									<h3>Microchip assembly</h3>
									<p>This ANSYS simulation analyzes a microchip assembly. The assembly consist of a base plate, microchip, and three connectors. The base plate and three connectors are made from copper while the microchip is made from porcelain. The microchip itself produces 25W of heat. This heat is then spread through the rest of the assembly and lost through the ambient 25 degree Celsius temperature. After viewing the results, it can be seen that the maximum temperature occurs at the top-middle portion of the microchip with a temperature of 176.52 degrees Celsius while the minimum temperature occurs at the far end of the base plate with a temperature of 86.055 degrees Celsius. It can also be said that the middle connector has an average temperature around 160 degrees Celsius. </p>

									<h3>Formula Frame</h3>
									<p>After reviewing that data, it shows that the rectangular tubing is a better solution for the formula frame than the circular tubing. For example, the total deformation of the rectangular frame is less than half of the circular tube frame. In addition to that, the maximum bending stress of the rectangular tubing frame is almost a third less than the circular tube frame. Lastly, while the direct stress occur mainly in the same locations on both frames, the stress itself has a lower magnitude on the rectangular tube frame. </p>

									<h3>2D Flow analysis over a car</h3>
									<p>This simulation and analysis was conducted in ANSYS. It was taken of a 2D model of a car of our choice. The car chosen was a Porsche GT2 RS. After finding a side profile blueprint of the car, a slide drawing was made in Solidworks. A flow region was then created around the car. The assembly was turned into a STEP file and imported into Workbench. The flow region and car were then meshed and analyzed. From wikipedia, it is said that the Porsche GT2 RS has a drag coefficient of .34; the ANSYS simulation conducted showed to have a drag coefficient of .39. I consider this a successful simulation considering I even drew the spoiler off the vehicle. This was not easy because the debate as to whether or not the supports of the spoiler should be added in the car drawing was brought up. In the end I decided not to add the spoiler supports that add to the back of the car because the analysis was taken of the mid-plane of the car. </p>

									<h3>Non-linear contact</h3>
									<p>This simulation analysis analyzes the ability of an O-Ring to seal like a gasket to a vacuum chamber. The simulation involved drawing three 2-d drawings and creating surfaces from them each. The material assignments were then given and the mesh was adjusted and created. Supports were then given to the groove and a downward displacement was given to the top plate. The simulation shows that the O-Ring deforms such that is makes full contact on the side walls of the grooved region. This indicates that the O-Ring was successful in maintaining a vaccuum.</p>

								<h2>About me</h2>
							</header>
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/kyle/262.jpg" alt="" /></span>I recently completed my Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering from the New Jersey Institute of Technology in December of 2021. I’m currently a drafting engineer at Economical Construction, specializing in construction. I have experience solving complex problems on diverse teams in both industry and academia. I have taken multiple leadership roles in teams ranging from 4 to 50 student and professional members, and have additional experience with project management, product development, finance, and website development.</p>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/kyle/fefe2.jpg" alt="" /></span> While in school, I took part in several internships to gather industry experience. My interests lie in mechanical design of electromechanical systems. When I am not advancing the state-of-the-art, I am actively taking classes, and always working to better myself as an engineer and person. I keep myself fit and my mind sharp by using my free time to run outdoors.  If not running, I’m working on side projects that earn me new skills or unwind by playing the acoustic guitar.</p>
